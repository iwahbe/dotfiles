# Dotfiles

Config files are stored in the `home` directory, laid out in the same way as they would be
in a users `$HOME` directory. Files and directories are
[softlinked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link) by `bin/config` from `./home` to
`$HOME`.

## Getting Started

The only tool that must be installed to work is `bash`. To get started, run `./bin/config up`.
